# 1v1 Live Fitness Duel

A live, interactive fitness duel platform where two players compete in real time using bodyweight exercises. The focus is on fairness, social interaction, and a mutual agreement on the winner—no tech stack decisions included.

## Concept
- Two players enter a live, head-to-head fitness duel.
- Both see each other on live video (picture-in-picture) during the duel and in the review room.
- Each duel is recorded automatically; no edits are allowed.
- After the duel, both players review performances and mutually agree on the winner.

## Core Loop
1. **Select Exercise** — Choose a bodyweight exercise and join the lobby for that movement.
2. **Auto-Match** — System pairs you with another player waiting for the same exercise.
3. **Countdown → Live Duel** — Short countdown, then live video starts with timer for rep-based exercises.
4. **Automatic Recording** — Camera angle guidelines enforced; recording runs for the duel.
5. **Duel Ends → Review Room** — Recording stops; both move to a shared review/waiting room.
6. **Review & Voice Chat** — Watch opponent’s recording (big view), keep PIP live video, talk via voice chat.
7. **Winner Decision** — Each player selects who they think won; a winner is declared only on mutual agreement.
8. **Result Finalized** — Optional rematch, streaks, or leaderboard points.

## Exercise Modes
- **Rep-Based (counted within a timed duel window)**
  - Squats
  - Push-ups
  - Sit-ups / Crunches
  - Jumping Jacks
  - Burpees

- **Failure-Based (live video call, messenger-style)**
  - Wall Sit
  - Plank  
  *Both players hold the position live; the first to fail loses. No timer governs the outcome—participants stop on their own and then agree on the winner.*

## Duel Experience
- **Live PIP Views:** See yourself and your opponent during duels and reviews.
- **Automatic Recording:** Ensures fairness; fixed camera angle guidance.
- **Interactive Review:** Replay both videos, compare effort, and use live voice chat to discuss reps, form, and outcome.
- **Mutual Winner Confirmation:** Only declare a winner when both players choose the same result.

## Fairness & Social Focus
- Visual, easy-to-count movements to reduce disputes.
- Live voice chat for real-time discussion and sportsmanship (or trash talk).
- Optional leaderboards, streaks, and rematches for progression and rivalry.
